#summary Overview description of the MEKON framework.

= MEKON =

MEKON is a framework for the creation of ontology-driven applications, wherein a set of externally represented ontologies, or ontology-like *knowledge sources*, together with associated *reasoning mechanisms* are accessed via a generic in-memory *frames-based model* and specifically-created instantiations of that model.

----
== Simplified Knowledge/Reasoning Access ==

MEKON simplifies client access of the underlying resources in the following ways:

 * *Knowledge access:* The frames-based model can hide much of the complexity of the representations in the underlying ontologies or other knowledge sources
 * *Reasoning access:* Model-instantiations are automatically updated as a result of behind-the-scenes invocations of the reasoning mechanisms

----
== Plug-In APIs + Knowledge Integration ==

Both the knowledge sources and reasoning mechanisms that drive the MEKON models are delivered via generic plug-in APIs, with MEKON itself being entirely agnostic as to the underlying formats and mechanisms. This enables applications to benefit from the *seamless integration* of various *disparate knowledge sources* and *disparate reasoning mechanisms*.

----
== Frames-Based Model  ==

The frames-based model provides a *domain-neutral API*, in which all domain concepts are represented via generic *frame* objects, and inter-concept relations and data-valued attributes via *slots* attached to the concepts.

----
== MEKON Applicability  ==

MEKON models are particularly suitable where:

 * *Externally-derived model:* The model can be derived entirely from a set of external knowledge sources
 * *No domain-specific mechanisms:* There is no requirement for any domain-specific procedural processing mechanisms to be attached to the model
 * *Totally generic applications:* The model will not be driving applications that need to embody any domain-specific knowledge

If the any of the above constraints do not hold then it may well be the a [HOBO] model will better meet your requirements.
