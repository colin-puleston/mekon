= MEKON-OWL =

Although the core [MEKON] and [HOBO] frameworks are *totally agnostic* concerning underlying *knowledge sources* and *reasoning mechanisms*, these frameworks were initially designed specifically with OWL-based applications in mind, and hence are *particularly suited* to *OWL ontology*-derived models and *Description Logic (DL)* reasoning.

MEKON-OWL consists of a pair *OWL-specific plug-ins* for [MEKON] (and hence for [HOBO]). These plug-ins are:

  * *OWL-based model section-builder plug-in:* Enables sections of MEKON models to be derived from OWL ontologies
  * *DL-based reasoning plug-in:* Enables automatic model-instantiation updating to be derived from DL reasoning over OWL ontologies

Both these plug-ins are built on top of the *OWL API*.
