= MEKON/HOBO Demo =

The MEKON/HOBO demo is based on a simple toy model representing a "citizen" via tax, benefits, personal-details, etc. 

The demo consists of the following:

 * *Demo OWL ontology:* A "citizen" ontology to be used as the source for the main section of the MEKON FM.
 * *Demo HOBO object model (OM):* Source code for a "citizen" OM, covering the core parts of the "citizen" ontology, and also including some additional entities not in the ontology. 
 * *Demo configuration file:* Configuration file containing (a) core MEKON constructs specifying the demo ontology as the source for the main section of the FM, plus (b) HOBO-specific constructs specifying the demo OM and the required OM/FM mappings.

The [Ant] build-script will create two "demo" scripts that will load the demo model into:

 * *MEKON model-explorer:* To explore the ontology-derived section only.
 * *HOBO model-explorer:* To explore hybrid combination of ontology and OM-derived sections.
