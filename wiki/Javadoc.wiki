= MEKON/HOBO Javadoc =

All [MEKON], [MEKON-OWL] and [HOBO] API code comes with *comprehensive Javadoc* comments. In all three cases, a detailed *overview description* of the sub-project code is provided by the package-overview file for the *root-package* of the relevant sub-project.

== Javadoc Generation Folder ==

The top-level folder in the MEKON project SVN contains a javadoc generation folder, "javadoc". This folder contains scripts for building:

 * *MEKON javadoc:* Javadoc for MEKON and MEKON-OWL
 * *HOBO javadoc:* Javadoc for HOBO, MEKON and MEKON-OWL

In both cases, the script references a *general overview description* file, which provides the description that will appear on the main index page of the javadoc. In both cases, this top-level overview description merely provides references to the overview descriptions for the component sub-projects (as mentioned above).

In both cases, the javadoc is created in a sub-folder of "the "javadoc" folder with an appropriate name (i.e. "mekon" and "hobo", respectively).

== Contents of Javadoc Generation Folder ==

The javadoc generation folder contains the following files:

 * *mkmekon.bat/sh:* Script that builds the MEKON javadoc
 * *mkhobo.bat/sh:* Script that builds the HOBO javadoc
 * *mekon-overview.html:* General overview description file for the MEKON javadoc
 * *hobo-overview.html:* General overview description file for the HOBO javadoc
