# Introductory Tutorial #

The tutorial provides an introduction to the MEKON and HOBO frameworks at the level of general principles and concepts. It does not provide code-level examples, though it does introduce the main classes in both frameworks.

The tutorial is based on the MEKON/HOBO Model Explorer, providing as a secondary goal, an introduction to the use of this tool. It uses the [MEKON/HOBO demo model](Demo.md) for it's examples.

The tutorial instructions are provided in the form of a set of PowerPoint slides. These slides can be found in the "docs" folder, contained in the the top-level folder of the Mekon project SVN.
