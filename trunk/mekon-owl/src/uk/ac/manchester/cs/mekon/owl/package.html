Root package for the MEKON-OWL plug-ins, which contains a collection of MEKON-friendly wrapper classes for the OWL API, which are used by the plug-ins, as well as providing the general MEKON-OWL overview documentation.

<H1>MEKON-OWL Overview</H1>

MEKON-OWL consists of a pair <b>OWL-specific plug-ins</b> for MEKON (and hence for HOBO). These plug-ins enable (a) MEKON/HOBO models to be derived from <b>OWL ontologies</b>, and (b) the automatic model-instantiation updating to be based on <b>Description Logic (DL)</b> reasoning. Both plug-ins are built on top of the <b>OWL API</b>.
<p>
The plug-ins are:
<ul>
  <li><b>Model-Section Builder:</b> {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.owl.sanctions.OSSectionBuilder} is an implementation of {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.mechanism.CSectionBuilder} which builds an indirect section of the frames model (FM) based on a set of OWL ontologies loaded via a standard "sanctioning" mechanism.
  <li><b>Instance Reasoner:</b> {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.owl.classifier.OCClassifier} is an implementation of {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.mechanism.IReasoner} based on a DL reasoner operating over a set of OWL ontologies.
</ul>

These plug-ins are compatible with each other, and can be used either together or seperately, in conjunction with other compatible section-building and reasoning plug-ins.
<p>
Both plug-ins are configurable in various ways, either programatically, via methods on the relevant classes, or else via the general MEKON configuration system.
<p>
{@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.owl.sanctions.OSSectionBuilder} can be configured to determine which collections of entities will be loaded from the relevant ontologies, and exactly how they will be used in creating the MEKON FM entities.
<p>
{@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.owl.classifier.OCClassifier} can be configured to determine how the FM will be interpreted semantically when composing the OWL expressions that are to be classified. It is also possible to add implementations of {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.owl.classifier.OCPreProcessor} to instances of {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.owl.classifier.OCClassifier}, which will reshape the FM instantiations prior to conversion into the OWL expression that will be classified.
<p>
Both plug-ins make use of the {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.owl.OModel} class, which provides MEKON-friendly access of OWL ontologies and DL reasoners via the OWL API. Similarly to the plug-ins themselves, the {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.owl.OModel} can be configured either programatically or else via the general MEKON configuration system.
