<BODY>
Package that provides a simple malleable node/link representation, instantiations of which can be derived from, and rendered into, instantiations of the standard MEKON frames representation. Used as an intermediate representation by both the {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.mechanism.IClassifier} and {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.mechanism.IMatcher} classes, as well as by the XML serialisation mechanisms for instance-level frames.
