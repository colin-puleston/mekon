Root package for the MEKON framework, which contains all MEKON-specific exception classes, as well as providing the general overview documentation for the framework.

<H1>MEKON Overview</H1>

<b>MEKON</b> is a framework for the creation of ontology-driven applications, wherein a set of externally represented ontologies, or ontology-like <b>knowledge sources</b>, together with associated <b>reasoning mechanisms</b> are accessed via a generic in-memory <b>frames model (FM)</b> and specifically-created instantiations of that model.
<p>
For a general overview of the MEKON framework and related software see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mekon/" target="_blank">Mekon project website</a>.

<H1>MEKON Packages</H1>

<H3>MEKON APIs</H3>

The <b>Model API:</b> provides the client representation of the FM.
<p>
The <b>Mechanism API:</b> provides the mechanisms for building and configuring the MEKON models. Incorporates the MEKON plug-ins API (or SPI - Service Provider Interface) that is used by providers of the following types of plug-in:
<ul>
  <li><b>Model-section builders:</b> Responsible for building sections of the FM derived from external knowledge sources of specific types
  <li><b>Reasoners:</b> Responsible for dynamic updating of model-instantiations based on reasoning mechanisms associated with external knowledge sources of specific types
</ul>

See below for further details on each of these APIs.

<H3>MEKON Class/Interface Naming Conventions</H3>

Within the MEKON API packages, the following single-character class-name prefixes are used to distinguish the broad category into which a class or interface falls:
<ul>
  <li><b>I:</b> Instance-level entities
  <li><b>C:</b> Concept-level entities
  <li><b>M:</b> Meta-level entities
  <li><b>F:</b> Non-level-specific entities
</ul>

Within the non-API MEKON packages (see below) the following prefix is used:
<ul>
  <li><b>K:</b> General/utility MEKON classes
</ul>

<H3>Frames Model API</H3>
<i>Package:</i> {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.model}
<p>
Models are loaded into the API as a concept-level {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.model.CFrame}/{@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.model.CSlot} network. Individual model-instantiations can then by created by the client in the form of instance-level {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.model.IFrame}/{@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.model.ISlot} networks.
<p>
The instance-level networks are dynamic in that any client-provided value-updates for slots on a particular frame may trigger automatic updates to the slot-set for that frame. These updates can be of the following types:
<ul>
  <li>Addition/removal of slots
  <li>Updates to value-constraints for particular slots
  <li>Addition/removal of inferred values for particular slots
</ul>
Such updates will be provided either by generic reasoning mechanisms associated with the external knowledge sources, or by procedural mechanisms associated with the OM.

<H3>Frames Mechanism API</H3>
<i>Package:</i> {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.mechanism}
<p>
The {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.mechanism.CBuilder} class is responsible for building the FM, which involves the following steps:
<ul>
  <li>Registration of set of section-builder plugins, one for each ontology
  <li>Invocation of registered section-builder plugins
  <li>Return of resulting {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.model.CModel} object
</ul>
The section-builder plugins are instances of specific extensions of {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.mechanism.CSectionBuilder}, with each such extension being responsible for loading ontologies of a specific type. The section-builders will use mechanisms accessible from {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.mechanism.CBuilder} to create and register an appropriate set of FM entities. The section-builders are also responsible for providing reasoning plugins, in the form of specific implementations of {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.mechanism.IReasoner}, and attaching them to appropriate frames, over whose instantiations they will perform any required reasoning.
<p>
The registration of the section-builder plugins can be done either via the API or via the MEKON configuration system.

<H3>General/Utility Packages</H3>

In addition to the main API packages, MEKON provides the following general/utility packages:
<ul>
  <li><b>Exceptions:</b> {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon}
  <li><b>Configuration-related:</b> {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.config}
  <li><b>General utilities:</b> {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.util}
</ul>
