Provides the classes and interfaces of the MEKON Instance-Store API (see {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon} for general description).
<p>
NOTE: This is a companion package to the {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon.store.motor} package, with which it shares circular dependencies at the implementation level, though not at the API level. See {@link uk.ac.manchester.cs.mekon} for further details.
